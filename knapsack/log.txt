****  Work Log
*******************************************

Development Problems:
	1. unsinged long long is used for the possible large number.
	2. possible issue with memory allocation that no continues heap memory is available for the large array.
	3. Reduce the number of if statements, division, modulus, and etc.


Algorithm Problems:
	1. Because of the dependency between the multiple partitioned blocks, some data calculated in the previous blocks need to be stored and passed to the later calculations.

Done:
	1. Serial implementation of knapsack is completed.
	2. Direct GPU implementation is completed.

To do:
	1. Static functions for constraint number of 1, 2, 3, and 4 for both serial and GPU implementations.
	2. Partitioning. Partition the constraints only, do not partition item.
