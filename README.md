This work is to create the memory efficient GPU implementation for multidimensional dynamic programming apporach.

We introduce the partition technique to make it possible to allocate the huge multidimensional table to the limited GPU memory.

Multiple problems are tested as the example to verify the feasibility of our proposed scheme.





Problems:

1. d-knapsack problem, solved by multidimensional dynamic programming approach.
